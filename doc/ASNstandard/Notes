Meeting Thursday, 08.08
Looked at the ASN.1 documentation, beginning of ch.8:
- DER and CER are subsets of BER, thus start with BER
- discussed the basic structure of BER:
  -- identifiers (8.12)
  -- contents
  -- length is complex (definite and indefinite)
  -- looked at Boolean and Integer encoding description

Todo:
1) find table with identifiers for primitive types
2) find precise definition of primite encoding
